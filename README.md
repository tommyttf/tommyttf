### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some of my work samples:  

## Order Service with Pharmacy Integration (Nest.js + Swagger + Jest + GitHub Action)
https://github.com/tommyttf/pharmacy-order-server  
Version 0.0.1 is simulating a server served as multiple pharmacy integrations using abstract class  
Version 0.1.0 is a server to call the integrations for ordering

## Student Result Management System (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma)
https://github.com/tommyttf/student-result-management-system  
https://student-result-management-system-nu.vercel.app/

This is my first time trying tRPC, together with Next.js, Redux and Prisma connecting to Mysql.

## Tools usage monitoring (Python + Flask + Swagger)
https://github.com/tommyttf/Tools-usage-monitoring

This is a Python Flask project, with OpenAPI doc defined and use Swagger-ui to generate a testing console.

## PNG to JPEG server using Node.js worker threads (Koa.js + Node.js worker threads + Jest + GitHub Action)
https://github.com/tommyttf/png-to-jpeg-using-worker-threads

This is using Node.js worker threads to improve speed when there is multiple requests to transform png to jpeg.
As this is not an I/O-intensive operation but CPU-intensive operation, we have to use worker threads to make it work.
